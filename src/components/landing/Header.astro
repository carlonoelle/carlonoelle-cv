            <p>
              For the past 7 years I have been hands on with real world problem
              solving in enterprise and sideproject IT needs. My interest in
              programming started besides school, when I was 14 years old.
              Starting at age 16, i could work part time as a software developer
              @ TIMETOACT, where I was able to gain a lot of experience in the
              field of software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              My speciality is in the field of web and mobile development, where
              I have been working with a wide range of technologies and
              frameworks. My main focus is on React with NextJS, React Native
              and NodeJS, all of which written in TypeScript. Databases i use
              regularely are PostgreSQL and MongoDB. To complete the buzzword
              bingo, i also have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure,
              GCP (my favorit), CI/CD, Terraform, Serverless, and many more. I
              do not like PHP or any more low level languages, since i want to
              iterate fast and stay cutting edge generally.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am skilled in project management through agile methodologies
              (SCRUM), used to work in a team and have basic to advanced
              experience with the most industry relevant tools out there like
              Jira, Confluence, Gitlab, Github, Slack, Teams, etc.
