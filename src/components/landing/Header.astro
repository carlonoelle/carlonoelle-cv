              Over the past {calculateYears(1468188000000)} years, I have gained hands-on experience in solving real-world IT problems through 
              both enterprise projects and side projects. My interest in programming began when I was 14 years old, 
              and by the age of 16, I started working part-time as a software developer at TIMETOACT. After high school, 
              I began my apprenticeship and studies, continuing to work full-time during and after that period. Since 
              then, I have accumulated substantial experience in software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              My expertise lies in web and mobile development, utilizing a wide range of technologies 
              and frameworks. I primarily focus on React with Next.js, React Native, and Node.js, all 
              written in TypeScript. The databases I commonly use are PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I 
              have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD, Terraform, Serverless, 
              and many other technologies or tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am proficient in project management through agile methodologies (SCRUM), 
              accustomed to working in teams, and have basic to advanced experience 
              with industry-standard tools such as Jira, Confluence, GitLab, GitHub, Slack, Teams, and more.
